This is an extension of the example keyboard code provided at <http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_keyboard.html>. I've modified it to allow more than 6 keys to be pressed at a time.  Please see usb_keyboard.c for more information on how I've modified it, and the license for that source code.

Right now the keys are hard coded into the source... but in the future, I think I will write a desktop application and interfaces to modify these key codes at run time.

If you have any problems with this software, please contact me at <dane@danegardner.com>.
